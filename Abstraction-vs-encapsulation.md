# Encapsulation 
<pre>Encapsulation is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit. It is the mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates. Another way to think about encapsulation is, it is a protective shield that prevents the data from being accessed by the code outside this shield.

Technically in encapsulation, the variables or data of a class is hidden from any other class and can be accessed only through any member function of own class in which they are declared.
As in encapsulation, the data in a class is hidden from other classes, so it is also known as data-hiding.
Encapsulation can be achieved by Declaring all the variables in the class as private and writing public methods in the class to set and get the values of variables.</pre>

```Java
// Java program to demonstrate encapsulation

public class Encapsulate {

	// private variables declared
	// these can only be accessed by
	// public methods of class
	private String geekName;
	private int geekRoll;
	private int geekAge;

	// get method for age to access
	// private variable geekAge
	public int getAge()
	{
		return geekAge;
	}

	// get method for name to access
	// private variable geekName
	public String getName()
	{
		return geekName;
	}

	// get method for roll to access
	// private variable geekRoll
	public int getRoll()
	{
		return geekRoll;
	}

	// set method for age to access
	// private variable geekage
	public void setAge(int newAge)
	{
		geekAge = newAge;
	}

	// set method for name to access
	// private variable geekName
	public void setName(String newName)
	{
		geekName = newName;
	}

	// set method for roll to access
	// private variable geekRoll
	public void setRoll(int newRoll)
	{
		geekRoll = newRoll;
	}
}

// Class to access variables
// of the class Encapsulate
class TestEncapsulation {
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		Encapsulate obj = new Encapsulate();

		// setting values of the variables
		obj.setName("Harsh");
		obj.setAge(19);
		obj.setRoll(51);

		// Displaying values of the variables
		System.out.println("Geek's name: " + obj.getName());
		System.out.println("Geek's age: " + obj.getAge());
		System.out.println("Geek's roll: " + obj.getRoll());

		// Direct access of geekRoll is not possible
		// due to encapsulation
		// System.out.println("Geek's roll: " + obj.geekName);
	}
}
```
# Abstraction 
<pre>
Data Abstraction is the property by virtue of which only the essential details are displayed to the user. The trivial or the non-essentials units are not displayed to the user. Ex: A car is viewed as a car rather than its individual components.

Data Abstraction may also be defined as the process of identifying only the required characteristics of an object ignoring the irrelevant details. The properties and behaviours of an object differentiate it from other objects of similar type and also help in classifying/grouping the objects.
</pre>
```java
// Java program to illustrate the concept of Abstraction

abstract class Shape {
	String color;

	// these are abstract methods
	abstract double area();
	public abstract String toString();

	// abstract class can have a constructor
	public Shape(String color)
	{
		System.out.println("Shape constructor called");
		this.color = color;
	}

	// this is a concrete method
	public String getColor()
	{
		return color;
	}
}
class Circle extends Shape {
	double radius;

	public Circle(String color, double radius)
	{

		// calling Shape constructor
		super(color);
		System.out.println("Circle constructor called");
		this.radius = radius;
	}

	@Override
	double area()
	{
		return Math.PI * Math.pow(radius, 2);
	}

	@Override
	public String toString()
	{
		return "Circle color is "
			+ super.color
			+ "and area is : "
			+ area();
	}
}

class Rectangle extends Shape {

	double length;
	double width;

	public Rectangle(String color,
					double length,
					double width)
	{

		// calling Shape constructor
		super(color);
		System.out.println("Rectangle constructor called");
		this.length = length;
		this.width = width;
	}

	@Override
	double area()
	{
		return length * width;
	}

	@Override
	public String toString()
	{
		return "Rectangle color is "
			+ super.color
			+ "and area is : "
			+ area();
	}
}

public class Test {
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		Shape s1 = new Circle("Red", 2.2);
		Shape s2 = new Rectangle("Yellow", 2, 4);

		System.out.println(s1.toString());
		System.out.println(s2.toString());
	}
}
